# 🚀 WordPress Plugin Playground 🛠️

Hey there! Welcome to my **WordPress Plugin Development** repository. This is where I'll be experimenting, breaking things, and creating some cool plugins! 😎

## 👨‍💻 What’s this about?

This repo is all about leveling up my WordPress plugin development skills. From basic stuff like hooks and filters, to advanced features, you’ll find all sorts of experimentation here. If you love WordPress and want to learn alongside, feel free to fork or star! ⭐

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Understanding the **WordPress Plugin API** 🔄
- Creating and managing custom **hooks** and **filters** 🧩
- Building **shortcodes** and custom functionality ⚡
- Experimenting with **custom post types** and **taxonomies** 📂
- Exploring **security best practices** 🛡️
- Testing **Kubernetes** deployments for scaling 🐳

## Install WordPress if you haven’t already. You can set it up locally with MAMP, XAMPP, or another local server of your choice. 🖥️

  Copy the plugin to your WordPress installation:
  Navigate to /wp-content/plugins/
  Copy the folder from this repo into /plugins/

  Activate your plugin in the WordPress dashboard, and start hacking away! 💻

## 🔥 Features & Experiments

This repo will evolve over time as I experiment with different concepts. Here’s what I’m working on right now:

  - Custom Hooks: Playing around with custom action and filter hooks 🛠️
  - Plugin Settings Page: Creating a simple settings page for the plugin ⚙️
  - Shortcodes: Building some fun shortcodes for easy content insertion 📝
  - Security Enhancements: Implementing basic security measures for the plugin 🔒
  - Kubernetes Practice: Moving from Docker to Kubernetes for better scalability 🐳➡️☸️

## 🎉 Future Plans

  - Create more advanced features like integration with external APIs 🚀
  - Add unit tests to ensure everything works flawlessly ✅
  - Package the plugin for distribution on the WordPress plugin repository 🌐
